# WEEK TWO CODE CHALLENGE

#### About

Second code challenge under phase 1 to test my understanding of components, props, state, events and data fetching in react
[Link to my project:] (/https://react-wk2-code-challenge-git-main-medrine-jepkemoi.vercel.app/)

## Description

A user of the site is expected to see and do the following:

1. See profiles of all bots rendered in `BotCollection`.
2. Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it. The selected bot should render in the `YourBotArmy` component. The bot can be enlisted only **once**. The bot **does not** disappear from the `BotCollection`.
3. Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the `YourBotArmy` component.
4. Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked
   "x", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the
   `YourBotArmy` on the frontend.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

To access my site:

1. Clone the repository into a desired folder.
2. Open the now local repository to access the code
3. Open / run the live server to be able to use the site. Once on the site, interact with it by adding transaction data on the form and clicking on its submit button so as to render the new data on the table. A user can click on the table so as to delete transaction data
